Primarily we recommend review the following:

* [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/)
* [Azure Architecture Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/)
* [Develop a cloud adoption strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/)
* [Cloud Design Patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/) (Read all challenges)
* [Solution Ideas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/architectures/)
