## What are study groups?

Community-based deep technical sessions with an emphasis on experiential learning.  Participants will be assigned homework that includes both reading and hands-on activities that are directly aligned to exam objectives.  A [private Yammer group](https://www.yammer.com/msuspartner/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=9161297&view=all) is available for students to ask questions so that your growth stays on track during this fast-paced learning environment. We'll also meet once a week to review key elements of the exam objectives.

Participants should complete the following prior to attending a study group:

- [AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-vn/training/assets/collection/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals#/)  (or have equivalent knowledge)
