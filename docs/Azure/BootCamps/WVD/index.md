# Technical Intensity Workshop - Windows Virtual Desktop Lab

## Overview

In this lab, attendees will deploy the [Windows Virtual Desktop
(WVD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/) *solution* .
Exclusively available as an Azure cloud service, Windows Virtual Desktop allows
you to choose a flexible end user virtualized application or desktop delivery
model that best aligns with your enterprise Azure cloud strategy. WVD simplifies
the IT model to virtualize and deploy modern and legacy desktop app experiences
with unified management—without needing to host, install, configure and manage
components such as diagnostics, networking, connection brokering, and gateway.
WVD brings together Microsoft Office 365 and Azure to provide users with the
only multi-session Windows 10 experience with exceptional scale and reduced IT
costs while empowering today’s modern digital workspace.
