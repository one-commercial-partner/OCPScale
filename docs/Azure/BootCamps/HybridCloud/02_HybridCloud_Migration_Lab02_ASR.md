# Azure Migration Lab #2

## Azure Site Recovery for Migration  

In this lab you will create a VM in Azure to simulate a source VM running in either VMware or Hyper-V on the ground.  We will then replicate (aka migrate) the VM to Azure.

Please note that using this approach represents `the fastest way` to migrate a VM to Azure and should not be seen as the usual, customary amount of time it takes to perform a migration to Azure.

## Task 1 - Create an IIS VM with PowerShell

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine running Windows Server 2016, and then uses the Azure Virtual Machine DSC Extension to install IIS. After running the script, you can access the default IIS website on the public IP address of the virtual machine.

1. This lab requires Azure PowerShell.  If you need to install Azure PowerShell, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).
2. Run the following command
```
    Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/one-commercial-partner/OCPScale/master/docs/Azure/BootCamps/HybridCloud/Build-IIS-VM.ps1" -OutFile Build-IIS-VM.ps1
```
4. Open PowerShell and Run `Connect-AzAccount` to logon to your Azure subscription.  If your current identity is connected to multiple Azue subscriptions, obtain the GUID of the subscription you want to use and issue the following syntax: 
```
    Connect-AzAccount  -SubscriptionId *GUID*
```
5. From PowerShell execute the build-iis-vm.ps1 script:
```
    .\Build-IIS-VM.ps1
```
6. When prompted enter the username and password for the IIS VM:
    * Username:  pick a username and notate the credentials
    * Password: Enter `Complex.Password` and notate the credentials 
7. Observe the build process via PowerShell.  Why does the PowerShell Command fail?  To correct the problem disable policy enforcement of the **Require tag and its value** policy.
8. Once PowerShell builds the VM and installs IIS, open the Azure Portal and then obtain the public IP address of the IIS virtual machine.
9. Open a web browser and surf to the public IP address just make sure things are working.

## Task 2 - Create target network resource

We could have ASR automatically create the target network resources (i.e. Virtual networks and subnets) but in a more realistic scenario you'd want to pre-create these resources and place your migrated VMs in soecific networks. 

1. Click on Virtual networks then **+Add**
2. Enter or select the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then select **Create**:
    * Name: **MigrationvNet**
    * Address Space: **10.10.0.0/16**
    * Resource Group: *Create New* **MigrationvNets**
    * Location: **Central US**
    * Subnet Name: **migsub**
    * Subnet address range: **10.10.10.0/24** 

## Task 3 - Create a Recovery Services vault

This task is the normal starting point for a typical lift and shift migration as you would normally have a robust source environment to migrate.

1. Click **+Create a resource > ManagementStorage > Backup and Site Recovery** and enter **MyVault** as the Name and **ASRMigration** as the Resource Group.  Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

## Task 4 - Select a replication goal

1. Once the vault deployment has succeeded, click on **Go to Resource** or in the search bar type in **MyVault** and select it.
2. In the **Getting Started** Menu, click **Site Recovery** > **Prepare Infrastructure**.
3. In **Protection goal**, set the following:
    * Where are your machines located?: **Azure**
    * Where do you want to replicate your machines to? **To Azure**
    * Click **OK**, and then **OK** again on the **Prepare Infrastructure** tab.

## Task 5 - Enable replication

1. In the Azure portal, click **Virtual machines**, and select the **IIS**.
2. Under **Operations**, click **Disaster recovery**.
3. In **Configure disaster recovery** > **Target region** select the target region to which you'll replicate and where you create the network resources in Task 2, which should be the Central US. Click **Next: Advanced settings**.
4. Under Advanced settings, set the following Target resources:  
    * VM resource group: **MigrationvNets**
    * Virtual network: **MigrationvNet**
    * Availability: **Availability set**
    * Click **Next: Review + Start Replication**.
5. Review the settings and click **Start replication**. This starts a job to enable replication (aka migration) for the VM.
6. You may notice that Vaildating and Creating target resources takes a few moments to process.  The fabric is ensuring that resources in your target region can be created and there’s no conflicts nor capacity issues.

## Task 6 - Track Replication

1. Once Azure has built the core components replication will begin.  On the alert button (the bell) click on **Enabling replication for 1 vm(s)**.
2. Notice the steps as they occur in real time.  The longest step in the process is going to be **Enable replication**.  Select that item and observe the series of steps taking place. IR, or Initial Replication, the time it takes the VM to be copied from source to target.  Notice the Status of IR.  
3. Since it may take 30 minutes to replicate the VM, now may be an appropriate time to take a break or come back to the lab at a later time.
4. You can check percentage complete of replication by **Virtual Machines > IIS > Operations > Disaster Recovery**.  You may notice status sits at 0% synchronized for some time and then report upwards of 87% complete on next refresh.

## Task 7 - Run a Test Failover

A test failover executes a failover but does not make the secondary or migrated VM active.  A drill validates your replication strategy without data loss or downtime and doesn't affect your production environment.

1. In the Azure Portal navigate to Virtual machines, then IIS, then Disaster Recovery.  Click the **Test Failover** icon.
2. In Test Failover, select **Latest (lowest RPO)** as the recovery point to use for the failover.  Note the following:
    * **Latest (lowest RPO):** Fails the VM over with the current state of the VM but requires some processing time.
    * **Latest processed (low RTO):** Fails the VM over to the latest recovery point that was processed by the Site Recovery service. The time stamp is shown. With this option, no time is spent processing data, so it provides a low RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
    * **Latest app-consistent:** This option fails over all VMs to the latest app-consistent recovery point. The time stamp is shown.
    * **Custom:** Use this option to fail over to a specific recovery point. This option is useful for performing a test failover.
3. Select the target Azure virtual network to which Azure VMs in the secondary region will be connected after the failover occurs, which in this lab is **MigrationvNet**.  
4. To start the failover, click **OK**. Track progress by selecting the alert in the Notifications window. 
5. After the failover finishes (Start the virtual machine task is successful), the replica Azure VM appears in the Azure portal under Virtual Machines. Make sure that the VM is running, sized appropriately, and connected to the appropriate network. Note that the VM does not have a Public IP address.
6. To delete the VMs that were created during the test failover, select **IIS** from **Virtual Machines**, select **Disaster recovery** under  **Operations**, and then choose **Cleanup test failover**. In Notes, record and save any observations associated with the test failover. Click the box for **Testing is complete** and click **Ok**.
If you don’t delete the failover VM, the VM will continue to run and increase your Azure consumption.

## Task 8 - Switch over to the migrated VM

 Once you have validated the migrated VM by performing a test failover, your next step would be to switch over to the migrated VM.  In this lab you will complete the migration.

 1. Once **Test Failover** is complete, click on **Failover**.
 2. Under **Recovery Point** enure that **(low RTO)** is selected and click **OK**. Note the checkbox to shut down the source VM before failover (migration). 
 Under alerts click the link for **Starting failover** and monitor the failover (migration).
 3. Once failover is complete, click on **Virtual Machines** in the Azure Portal and notice that you have two IIS VMs; one stopped (deallocated) in the East US and then another VM in the Central US that's running.

## Task 9 - Make your migrated VM accessible

 When you migrate a VM a public IP address is not added by default and the Virtual Network does not have any Network Security Group rules.  We need to add all of these.

 For real production migrations Microsoft recommends that you add these steps to what is called a recovery plan so that they are automatically built and added as the VM is migrated.
