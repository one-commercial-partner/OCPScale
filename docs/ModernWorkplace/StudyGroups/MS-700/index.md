## What are study groups?

Community-based deep technical sessions with an emphasis on experiential learning.  Participants will be assigned homework that includes both reading and hands-on activities that are directly aligned to exam objectives.  A private Yammer group is available for students to ask questions so that your growth stays on track during this fast-paced learning environment. We'll also meet once a week to review key elements of the exam objectives.

## What are the requirements?

Participants should complete the following prior to attending a study group:

- Entry Level knowledge of Microsoft Teams Administration
- VILT training for the exam you wish to take
- Working M365 Subscription (Visual Studio or IUR)

## What is in this repo?

Simple ... Each file listed is a separate homework assignment, one for each of the exam objectives.
If you see a typo or want to add content that others may find useful, edit away and submit your changes!
Additionally, if you see something, say something!  Let's leverage the power of the community.

**If you run across an interesting blog post, article, nugget of truth, update the documents on Github!**
